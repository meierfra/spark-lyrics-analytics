Elijah Blake,"No, no
I ain't ever trapped out the bando
But oh Lord, don't get me wrong
I know a couple niggas that do
I'm from a place where everybody knows your name
They say I gotta watch my attitude
When they see money, man they all start actin' strange
So fuck with the ones that fuck with you
They can never say I'm brand new

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
I've been talkin' my shit, nigga that's regular
I've been lovin' 'em thick, life is spectacular
I spend like I'ma die rich, nigga I'm flexin', yeah
Everyday, that's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday, everyday

I see all of these wanna-be hot R&B singers
I swear you all sound the same
They start from the bottom, so far from the motto
You niggas'll never be Drake
Shout out to OVO
Most of them prolly don't know me though
I stay in the cut, I don't fuck with no
Body but I D, that's a pun on No I.D
When nobody know my name
Runnin' for my dream wasn't hard to do
You break bread, I swear they all pull out a plate
Eat with the ones who starved with you
If I'm winnin' then my crew can't lose

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
I've been talkin' my shit, nigga that's regular

I spend like I'ma die rich, nigga I'm flexin', yeah
Everyday, that's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday
That's everyday, everyday

I heard since you got money
You changed, you're actin' funny
That's why I gets on my lonely
You be lovin' when change is a hobby
Who do you dress when you ain't got nobody?

It's everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday

Elijah Blake,"The drinks go down and smoke goes up, I feel myself, got to let go
My cares get lost up in that crowd that go up, up and away yo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

Ain't kill my vibe, don't blow my high, don't doubt that he from the band though
I'm listening to this song, now I'm up up and away yo

Nights like this, I go all out, up so high, I can't come down
Let me live just for right now
Yeah, yeah, bite me, I'm so gone

Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
No squares in my circle, get up out my way
Happier than a motherfucker, I can't feel my fa-ace
Who you tryna dance? Get up out my way

When I'm out at night, I chase neon lights
All of my thoughts start to echo, yeah they start to echo

Slow down the lights, eyes open wide
We live till we die, live till we die, live till we die

So I'ma roll the dice, and I hope that I
Don't take more than I can handle, much than I can handle

Elijah Blake,"She don't live on planet Earth no more
She found love on Venus, that's her word
Said she needed space, time to explore
Now she movin' on and on and on and on

Is it might fault that you're broken, is it my fault that your'e high?
You caught me cheating with my ex-girlfriend, but instead of calling me I caught her

I was like ""man, oh shit, my new girl fuckin' with my old chick""
We both bad, so she switched, packed her bags, said she had to take a trip
To the otherside, the otherside, the otherside
She's gone, she's gone, she's gone, to the otherside

Can we get back to how it was before?
If I can't have you, at least show me what's in store
And what I've made is [?] come forward more
Then we can go on and on and on and on

Trippin' off that Grigio, mobbin', lights low

Baby I'm surprised you picked up this late at night
And I'm not tryna start a fight
But I hate the way we ended and the fact you got me cheated
I hate these new beginnings even though I am the reason
The only thing I love right now is you

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

[Hook 1]
I'm just trippin' off that Grigio
It sucks to see that you don't feel me though
Pour me a glass and let my feelings blow

Aw baby, aw baby, I ain't no drinker but it's gettin' me though

I don't know why your father never like me
Was it because of my [?]boy ways and this white tee? Your eye
Always thought your momma was a winner
Considering her only stayed together after all those years
You think that we could learn from them

I miss ya going through my phone
And calling up the numbers you don't know
The make up sex, even when it's wrong
Our love was that strong

Nights like this, we should be trippin' off that Grigio
Telling me secrets that nobody knows
Pour us a shot and cut the music on

Elijah Blake,"I see a midnight panther, so gallant and so brave
I found, I found the answers in the thunder and the rain
You made a promise that you would never leave me alone

That's what I get for trusting love

I see a fresh a cut diamond, coal minor's are dirty and cruel

That's who I love the most

When you smile slightly crooked
That's your style, don't you fix it
Girl you got a hold on me
Don't wanna play no games, this is do or die
And I don't mind if you get comfortable and gain a little weight
'Cause you're so fine, and just like whine you get a little better everyday

You're the only one, you're the only one
You're the only one, you're the only one

Elijah Levi,"Lullaby of Birdland, that's what I 
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland 
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel

Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic 
Music we make with our lips when we kiss

And there's a weepy old willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

Pulls that man around by her, if it wasn't for her and her

Silhouettes bring confidence and peace to me.

Of an altogether admirable man.

I have fashioned a marble image
Of everything I'd like you to see.
Without the things I hate about me.

This is all that I am.
I am all that I am.
If I accept this, I am free,
In mind, In body.

So don?t ask; I won't tell.
Just read the insert of the c.d. in the player
Because the player's got it figured out,
With all the hype and the hooks but the facts left.

Elio e le Storie Tese,"Quando ero piccolo tutti mi sherzavano
Per le dimensioni del mio pene, ed io non stavo bene.
Soffrivo le pene per colpa del pene, ma più il problema non si pone:
Sì, perchè il pene mi dà il pane, son diventato un grande attore
E, benchè schiavo dell'amore, mi son comprato una moto.
E ora son schiavo della moto, non faccio più moto,
Infatti vado solo in moto,
Ma ora sono diventato un mito:
Ho rilanciato il film muto
Perchè sono muto,
E se vedrete il filmato sicuramente converrete con noi che questà è verità.

Di dimensione artistica.
Su di ciò la critica è concorde
Nel ritenermi sudicio.
Perchè non hanno capito
Non parlo perchè son rapito,
E poi in faccia non son mai inquadrato
Però dal pubblico son venerato:
Ho rilanciato il film muto
Perchè sono muto
E se fossi stato ceco
Avrei lanciato il film ceco
E se fossi stato m
Avrei lanciato il filmmm.
Dicon che faccio film penosi
Perchè lavoro col pene.
E insomma il pene mi dà il pane, il pene mi da sì la moto
Ma la moto non da pene
Perchè funziona bene
Si si la moto non da pene

Elio e le Storie Tese,"When I was just a boy,
Everyone made fun of me,
Just because my penis was enormous,
My mom said it was gorgeous.

I work in a circus because of my penis,
And everybody says: “No problem!”,
Because my penis makes my living,
Now I became a famous actor,
And even though I’m just a slave to love,
I bought myself a rasta Harley.

Now I’m a slave to my new Harley
I got it from Bob Marley,
It’s rasta ‘cause it was Bob Marley’s,
Sometimes I reggae with Ziggy Marley.

I will relaunch the silent movie
Because Bob told me that it’s groovie,
And if you see that forty jumps of that children
We will act like: this is fondamentally the truth.

Twelve inches, it’s one foot
Of artistic reality,
That is what attracted all the critics,
Not my acting ability,
Because they simply don’t get it,
I don’t speak ‘cause I eat spaghetti,
And so my face is normally off-screen,
All of the people still come to adore me,
And now they’ve made me into a big style.

I relaunched the silent movie,
Because I am silent,
And even if I had been born dumb,
I’d have relaunched the dumb movie,
And if I had been born XXX
I’d have relaunched the XXX movie
I am your fire and your Venus,
Because I’m acting with my penis,
And so my penis makes my living,
My penis is very forgiving,
All my Harleys don’t forgive me,
And I’m asking for forgiveness,
Yes yes my Harleys don’t forgive me,
And I’m asking for forgiveness.

Betrayal, you betrayed me
You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend
Now I hate you
So much
You betrayed me with a kiss
You never really cared
It turned out to be wrong
So wrong
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes
Betrayal, you betrayed me
Discussing all the things with you
I told you all my secrets
You told it to the world
And laughed about it
I would have given anything
If you just asked me for
I was too good for you
Too good for you
Now I ask you
Why did it have to be like this
'Cause I miss you
Sometimes
Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes

You betrayed me with a kiss
I thought you were my friend
Now I hate you

Can you trust in your friend's words
Can he look into your eyes

This unwanted life 
Don't you know it has to prove 
During its whole life 
That it has a right to exist 

Two bodies cling together 
Mindless heat
Two bodies cling together 
Cruel lust
Two bodies cling together 

And then it starts to grow
This little baby child 
This unwanted life 
Don't you know it has to prove 
During its whole life 
That it has a right to exist 

A child is born
Out of the womb of a mother 
Who didn't want it 
It happened in a night
Of drunken passion and no thought 
About the consequence",Child
